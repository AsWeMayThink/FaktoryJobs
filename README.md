# Introduction

A demonstration of using Faktory to handle background jobs.

You will need to install Node.js onto the machine and you will need to [install faktory](https://github.com/contribsys/faktory/wiki/Installation). I used Docker most of the time for faktory, but any method should work.

After that run "npm install" to make sure all the Node packages are installed and then:

```bash
nodemon scheduler.js
```
